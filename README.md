# BuildToScale
Made for the GMTK Game Jam 2024

## Concept Idea
We play a little robot that was build by a company with the power to affect and change the world around him : he can scale items. First, we will have a mini game / tuto :

- We need to recreate the form that is presented
- It will be harder and harder
- there is a quota


if the quota is not respected, the robot will perish. However, its the perfect opportunity to escape the factory and discover the world
